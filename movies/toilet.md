description: "“Toilet: Ek Prem Katha,” is, first, a love story between Keshav
  (Akshay Kumar) and Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar), that is inspired by a real story
  that took place in North India between a Mr. & Mrs. Naare (duly acknowledged
  in the end credits). Both reel and reel stories have an (absent!) toilet and a
  stinking (pun intended!) centuries-old and patriarchal herd mentality as the
  main villains."
