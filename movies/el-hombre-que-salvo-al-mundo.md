description: On 26 September 1983, the computers in the Serpukhov-15 bunker
  outside Moscow, which housed the command center of the Soviet early warning
  satellite system, twice reported that U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles
  were heading toward the Soviet Union. Stanislav Petrov, who was duty officer
  that night, suspected that the system was malfunctioning and managed to
  convince his superiors of the same thing. He argued that if the U.S. was going
  to attack pre-emptively it would do so with more than just five missiles and
  that it was best to wait for ground radar confirmation before launching a
  counter-attack.
